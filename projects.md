# Projects

As I'm a Junior, I don't have a lot of experience, so I have projects to show my
skills.

Most of my projects are different implementations of "Adeeb أديب" project. It's
concerned with arabic literature: poetry and prose. It assumes a business model
to order a specific piece of literature to be printed with especial color, font
then it'll be delivered to the customer, with the ability for the customer to
follow up the process.

### Implementations:

- Vue, Pinia and vue-router for the frontend,
  [check repo](https://github.com/M-Shrief/Adeeb_Vue_TS 'github repository for the FrontEnd').

- Node/Express and MongoDB for the backend,
  [check repo](https://github.com/M-Shrief/Adeeb_ExpressTS 'github repository for the BackEnd').

**Currently finishing:**

- Developing SSR front-end for "Adeeb أديب" using Quasar Framework and Vue,
  [check repo](https://github.com/M-Shrief/Adeeb_Quasar_SSR 'github repository').

- Migrating "Adeeb أديب" Backend to use PostgreSQL with TypeORM,
  [check repo](https://github.com/M-Shrief/Adeeb_ExpressTS_Postgres 'github repository').

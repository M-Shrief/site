### “Adeeb أديب” (personal project) - Jan. 2023 – Present

It's concerned with Arabic literature. It assumes a business model that enables
you to order a specific piece of literature to be printed with especial colors
and font. Then it'll be delivered to the customer, with the ability for the
customer to follow up the process. And for special customers, it provides them
with the ability to make bulk orders fast and easy. And if they’re willing to
signup, they can review all of their past orders.
